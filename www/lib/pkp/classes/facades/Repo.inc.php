 *
 * @brief This facade provides access to all Repositories in the application.
 *
 * A Repo contains all the methods needed to interact with an entity, such
 * as CRUD operations as well as utility methods to check status, locate items
 * and perform bulk actions.
 *
 * A Repository is a wrapper around an entity's DAO where additional business
 * logic can be performed. Use the Repository to coordinate actions across the
 * application, such as firing events, writing activity logs, or refreshing
 * cached data. The Repository should hand off data to the DAO to perform
 * basic crud operations.
